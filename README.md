# Cate Compsci Challenges

Welcome to the CCC (Cate Compsci Challenges) repo! Every week we'll post a new challenge.

To submit your response, send us your answer, along with any code you used, over email. You can email any one of us (but preferably CC all of us) at:
- `joshua_park@cate.org`
- `brandon_man@cate.org`
- `cloris_cheng@cate.org`
- `alex_kim@cate.org`

If you complete the challenge with a compiled language, please send us the code _and_ the compiled executable. It doesn't matter what you build it for, we should be able to find someone who can run it. (If you don't understand what this means don't worry about it.)

The person with the most correct answers will get a $20 gift card at the end of the trimester. We'll also probably announce you in assembly.

Good luck.
