# Cate Compsci Challenges!

Hello! Welcome to the Cate Compsci Challenges repo (that's computer speak for "bunch of files").

Every week, we upload a new challenge. You have until the end of the trimester to submit a program that completes it to one of us. You can use any programming language you wish, but if you're a beginner it's probably worth looking up some Python tutorials.

Each correct submission is worth one entry into a raffle. At the end of the trimester, we'll pull one lucky winner for a $20 gift card to a place of your choice. (We could also just hand you a twenty but that's kind of weird.)

If you decide to solve a challenge with a compiled language please make sure you can compile your solution to Windows and Mac. (If you don't know what this means, it doesn't apply to you, so don't sweat it!)

To enter a challenge, please email your submission to all of:
- `brandon_man@cate.org`
- `joshua_park@cate.org`

If you want to submit your own challenge, or be in charge of the challenges next year, feel free to email either of us. The only criterion is having a Github account (and this is just so we can give you access to the repo.)

Good luck!
