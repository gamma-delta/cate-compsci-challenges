# Fibonacci

Create a function that takes a single number as an argument and returns a list of fibonacci numbers with that length.

Your solution cannot just use a lookup table: you have to create the numbers yourself.

Example:
```python
>>> fibonacci(8)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
>>> fibonacci(12)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]
```

If you're bored and looking for a new programming language to learn it might be worth looking into Haskell.
