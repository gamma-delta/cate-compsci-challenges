# Palindromes

A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same backwards and forwards. Capitalization and spaces are not considered when reading a palindrome. Examples include: Race car, Sonos (Thanks Mr MacFarlane), Bob, madam

Create a function that takes a word as an input. If it’s a palindrome, your function returns true. If not, it should return false. Your function must be able to handle cases with capitalization or with spaces.

Example:

```python
>>> palindrome("Bob")
True
>>> palindrome("Arimfexendrapuse")
False
>>> palindrome("A Man, A Plan, A Canal – Panama")
True
```
