# Monty Hall Problem Extended
Make your Monty Hall program simulate the game a 1000 times where the player always switches their door. Print the number of times the player wins a goat and the number of times the player wins a car. What do you notice about the winning ratio? Was this what you expected? Bonus credit if you can explain what happened.
