# BMI Calculator

The formula for BMI is:
```
Weight (kg)/ [height (m)]^2
```
A BMI of 25 or above is overweight, while a BMI below 18.4 is underweight. A healthy person’s BMI is 18.5-24.9. Create a function that takes the weight and height of someone and calculates their BMI and tell them if they’re overweight, underweight or healthy.
